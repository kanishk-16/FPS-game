# 🎮 Multiplayer FPS Game with OpenGL 🖥️

## Project Overview 📜
This is a personal project to develop a simple multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) game using OpenGL. The game allows multiple players to join, 🔫 each other, and gain 🏆. The player with the highest number of 💀 wins, and respawns occur upon ☠️. This project is for 🎉 and to learn about 🕹️ development basics, 🖌️ programming, and 🌐.

## Features ⭐
- **Multiplayer Gameplay**: Multiple 👥 can join and 🏁 in real-time.
- **Basic Shooting Mechanics**: Players can 🔫 bullets at each other to score 🏅.
- **Respawn System**: Players ☠️ upon being killed.
- **Leaderboard**: Display the player with the highest number of 💀.

## Development Tools and Libraries 🛠️
- **Programming Language**: 💻 C++
- **Graphics Library**: 🖌️ OpenGL
- **Window Management**: 🪟 GLFW
- **Loading OpenGL Functions**: 📦 GLAD
- **Networking**: 🌐 TBD (e.g., ENet, Boost.Asio, or custom implementation)

---

## System Requirements 🖥️
- **Operating System**: 🪟/🐧
- **Graphics Card**: 🎮 NVIDIA GTX 1650 or equivalent (with 🖌️ support)
- **Processor**: 🧠 Intel i5-10th Gen or equivalent
- **RAM**: 8️⃣ GB or higher

## Project Goals 🎯
1. **Graphics Programming**:
   - Render a 3️⃣D 🌍 (e.g., basic level design with 🧱 and obstacles).
   - Implement a first-person 🎥 view.
2. **Multiplayer Mechanics**:
   - Establish a 👥-🌐 architecture for communication.
   - Synchronize player actions in real-time.
3. **Game Logic**:
   - Implement 🔫, collision detection, and 🏅.
   - Handle ☠️ mechanics.
4. **Optimization**:
   - Ensure smooth 🏃 performance on mid-range 🖥️.

## Project Setup 🛠️
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FPS-Game.git
   cd FPS-Game
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - 🪟 GLFW
   - 📦 GLAD
   - 🌐 library (to be decided)
3. **Build the Project**:
   - Use `g++` or ⚙️ CMake to compile the project:
     ```bash
     mkdir build && cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     ```
4. **Run the Executable**:
   ```bash
   ./FPS-Game
   ```

## Current Progress 📈
- **Completed**:
  - Set up an OpenGL 🪟 with GLFW and GLAD.
  - Basic rendering (e.g., background 🎨).
- **In Progress**:
  - First-person 🎥 and controls.
  - 🌐 for multiplayer 🕹️.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Implement 🔫 mechanics and collision detection.
  - Build a basic 🏆board.
